## Hi there 👋
I'm lorenzonebolosi — a Software Engineer at SurSum with a passion for robotics, computer vision, and machine learning.

### 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
During my years in computer science I've had the opportunity to work on different projects with different technlogies.
This allowed me to strengthen my skills in:
- Languages: Python, Java, C, C#
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Docker
- Packages and Framework: Tensorflow, pytorch, OpenCV, Maven, .NET
### 💡 Interests & Projects
With a background in Machine Learning and Neural Networks, I’m especially interested in building intelligent systems that intersect with robotics and computer vision. My recent work includes:

- A thesis on Applications of Graph Neural Networks for PDEs
- Various robotics and sensor system projects from my studies
- A Java-based MVC implementation of the game Maestri del Rinascimento
- An efficiency driven implementation of different algorithms such as Dijkstra's for Bachelor's degree final test.
### 🌄 Outside of Tech
When I'm not coding, you'll find me in the mountains—whether it’s climbing, cycling, or skiing. I’m always up for a new adventure in the outdoors!
