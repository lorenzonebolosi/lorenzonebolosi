MSc in computer science engineering, focus on Robotics, Data analysis and computer vision. During my years of high school and University I had the opportunity to learn work with different frameworks and tools, such as git, github, docker, and maven. Currently working in a start up company that was founded as a spin-off from Politecnico di Milano. As a software engineer I define and implement different architectures for the software used to perform 0D/1D CFD simulations of internal combustion engines.
